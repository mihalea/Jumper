# Jumper


This is an action packed infinitely-generated platformer game built in Java with the use of libGDX. It was my first project of this kind so I wanted to try my hand at building a physics engine from scratch. The game has three levels of difficulty and two game modes: Survival and Time Attack. All the sprites have been hand crafted by me pixel by pixel. A snapshot of the game can be seen below, while the distributable is available along with the source code.

*Note: As opposed to what it says, this project was finished in 2012. It has only been packed and uploaded here in 2015*
